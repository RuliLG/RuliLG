### Hi there 👋

My name is Raúl López and I am (mainly) a full stack web developer from the Canary Islands. I love working with technologies like Laravel + VueJS + TailwindCSS, as well as with the TALL stack. Also a Pythonist 🐍 and a Swift 🕊 person.

These are some of my side projects:

- [OpenGraphr](https://opengraphr.com/): Open Graph debugging tool and easy API
- [Tailgraph](https://tailgraph.com/): Free Open Graph image generation tool using TailwindCSS
